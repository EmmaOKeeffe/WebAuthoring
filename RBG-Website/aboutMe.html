                        My name is Emma Oâ€™Keeffe and I am currently a student at Griffith College studying a Post Graduate Diploma in Interactive Digital Media. This is my final assignment for my module Web authoring. I have an odd education past including a Diploma in Dental Nursing in Trinity College and a B.Sc in Computer Application (Software Engineering) in DCU. I have been working as a full stack Software Engineer in Microsoft for nearly two years and was a STAR intern at SAP for two years while studying my undergraduate. Front end development and design has always been a passion of mine and area I am always looking to gain more experience in hence I embarked on this course.
                        <br><br>
                        The final assignment for my Web Authoring module was to make a website about my Hero. For my her I picked U.S. Supreme Court justice, Ruth Bader Ginsberg. The reason I picked Ruth as my hero is that I think she was a really inspiring and empowered woman who paved the way for many women behind her in terms of equal rights. Although I don't have any interest in law, I watched a documentary about Ruth shortly after her death and hadn't realised how such a petite and seeminly quiet woman could be so outspoken and passionate about fighting for everyone to have equal rights. Her active support of the LGBTQ+ community attempting to give a voice to the people who felt voiceless did not go unseen and was greatly appreciated by all in minority groups. She not only just spoke of helping but also donated her 1 million dollar award winnings across 60 charities. Her hard work and determined attitude is something eveyone could be inspired by and her prescence in the world will be greatly missed.
